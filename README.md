##  Project Overview

### Workflow:
1. User uploads a receipt image to an S3 bucket (`incoming/` folder).
2. A Lambda function is triggered by this upload.
3. The Lambda function uses **Amazon Textract** to extract data from the image.
4. Extracted data is stored in a **DynamoDB** table.
5. A confirmation email with receipt details is sent using **Amazon SES**.
